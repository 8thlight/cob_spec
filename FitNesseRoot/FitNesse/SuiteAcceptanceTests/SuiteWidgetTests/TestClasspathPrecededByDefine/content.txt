!3 BUG - when you define a classpath entry on a line immediately following a variable definition, the classpath entry is not processed and the fixtures are therefore not found.
----

First, build a page with variable definitions followed immediately by a classpath definition. Also include a test that should pass.

!|script|
|given page|ClasspathTestPage|with content|!define PI {3.141592}!-<br>-!!path classes!-<br>-!!path fitnesse-standalone.jar!-<br>-!&bar;fitnesse.testutil.PassFixture&bar;!-<br>-!|
|its test results should contain|PassFixture|
|and should not contain|Exception|
