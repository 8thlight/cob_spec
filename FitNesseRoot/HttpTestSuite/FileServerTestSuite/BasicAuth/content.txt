!-<i>The <code>/logs</code> url should be protected with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.0/spec.html#BasicAA">basic access authentication</a>.
A request passing username "admin" and password "hunter2" should return log information. All others should return a 401 Unauthorized response.
Additionally, the <code>/logs</code> url only allows <code>GET</code> requests. Any authenticated requests with verbs other than <code>GET</code> should return a 405 Method Not Allowed response.</i>-!
