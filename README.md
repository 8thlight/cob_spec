Cob Spec
========
Cob Spec is a suite of tests used to validate a web server to ensure it adheres to [HTTP specifications](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230). These acceptance tests were created using a testing suite called [FitNesse](http://fitnesse.org). FitNesse is an application testing suite that allows you to test the business layer of your application.

The test helper code used by FitNess is located in `src/main/java`. Be aware that the Cob Spec will not regenerate the `/public` directory between executions and it is therefore possible for this directory to end up in a bad state.

The tests are grouped into sub-suites. You should aim to complete the `File Server` suite first as this will lay the groundwork for your server's functionality. Your challenge is then to elegantly integrate the further test requirements into your design.

Setup
------------

Cob Spec requires [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) and [JDK 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html) to be installed to run correctly.  

Getting Started
----------------

To test your server against the Cob Spec suite of tests, follow the instructions below.

    git clone git@github.com:8thlight/cob_spec.git
    cd cob_spec
    mvn package  
  
Starting Fitnesse Server
------------------------
Start the Fitnesse server on port 9090.

<!-- code -->
    java -jar fitnesse.jar -p 9090

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:9090. You should see the Cob Spec website.

Configuring Cob Spec
-------------------
To run the tests you have to change some variables.

- Navigate to the HttpTestSuite.
- Click on Edit.
- Update the paths for the User-Defined Variables.
  - `SERVER_START_COMMAND` is the command to start your server.
    - Example: `java -jar /User/somebody/project/my_jar.jar`
  - `PUBLIC_DIR` is the path to cob spec public folder.
    - Example: `/User/somebody/cob_spec/public/`
- Note that you have to remove the `-` at the beginning of the line in order for
  the User-Defined Variables to be recognized.
- Click Save.

Http Server
--------------
Your server jar needs to take two command line arguments.
- `-p` which specifies the port to listen on. Default is `5000`.
- `-d` which specifies the directory to serve files from. Default is the `PUBLIC_DIR` variable.

Running Tests
-------------
- To run all tests, click the `Suite` button.
- To run the file server request tests, first click the `File Server Test Suite` link, then click the `Suite` button.
- To run the dynamic route request tests, first click the `Dynamic Routes Test Suite` link, then click the `Suite` button.
- To run the tests that require threading, first click the `Simultaneous Test Suite` link, then click the `Suite` button.
- To run a test individually, first click on the test link, then click the `Test` button.
